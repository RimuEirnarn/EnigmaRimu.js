# EnigmaRimu.js

This is just another shitty JavaScript framework for static websites and makes it looks like dynamic.

No, this wouldn't be as good as many SPA applications that can be served for static website. I'll use it internally.

No, there are no template/page sanitizing. This assumes the whole site is NOT tampered.

Yes, there is user-input sanitizing.

## Features

- [x] Templating (partial?)
- [x] Paging/routing
- [x] Downloader or something
- [x] Notification (why not?)
- [x] Forms handlers and actions (i don't even know what is actions)
- [x] Elements stuff (mostly just modifiers so you can have little bit dynamics in HTML codes)
